My name is Briruk Mequanenet. I can from ethiopa and I live in addis abeba. I am a person who is positive about every aspect of life. There 
are many things I like to do. I like to paint, I like to see the moonlight at night , I like food specially Burger, I like to feel the 
misic . when I cannot seelp in the middle of the night. I like flowers in spriyrain in summer,leaves in autumn. I always wanted to be
a geat Architerer, like Ad rian smith who designed "Burg khalifa" or like stephen sauvestre who designed "effil tower". They have influenecd 
millon of people through their designes. I also wanted to be great Architect like stephen sauvestre or Aivaro siza, of course. I am no where 
close to these people yet. I am just some one who does some teaching. some research and some writing.but my dream is stin a live. This is 
all about my self.
