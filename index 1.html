      Construction management (CM) is a professional service that uses specialized, project management techniques to
       oversee the planning, design, and construction of a project, from its beginning to its end. The purpose of 
       Construction management is to control a project's time / delivery, cost and qualityâ€”sometimes referred to as 
       a project management triangle or "triple constraints."[1] CM is compatible with all project delivery systems,
        including design-bid-build, design-build, CM At-Risk and Public Private Partnerships. Professional construction 
        managers may be reserved for lengthy, large-scale, high budget undertakings
       (commercial real estate, transportation infrastructure, industrial facilities, and military infrastructure), called capital projects.
