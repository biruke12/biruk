        A construction safety officer ensures that construction workers are 
        following established policies and safety regulations. A construction safety officer may
         take on additional roles and responsibilities, but their primary job is to help create safer construction sites.
         Construction safety aims to ensure that a construction site or the industry as a whole is not 
         the cause of immediate danger to the public around a construction site, or the workers at a construction site, 
         as well as making sure that the finished product of construction meets required safety standards.
